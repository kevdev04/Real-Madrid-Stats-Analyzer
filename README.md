## Details

Machine Learning Model
The project includes a machine learning model for predicting player performance. The model uses a linear regression approach and takes into account various features such as matches played (MP), minutes played (Min), and goals (Gls) among others.

Model Training
Data for model training is sourced from the player_data_final.csv file.
The model is trained using the RM_Stats.ipynb script.
Model Prediction
Predictions for player performance after a specified number of matches can be obtained using the RM_PModel.ipynb script.

here is a little demostration of the train and prediction models content:
